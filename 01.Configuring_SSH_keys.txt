SSH-Keys : 
----------

This section will let you know how to configure and use the SSH RSA keys.

Step 1 : Make the SSH directories and change permissions
	Make a .ssh directory under users home directory and change perms to 700
	# mkdir ~/.ssh
	# chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
	
	Make a directory with the username under /etc/ssh directory
	# mkdir /etc/ssh/arjun
	
	Change the perms of this dir to 755 and change the ownership to self
	# chmod 755 /etc/ssh/arjun
	# chown arjun:arjun /etc/ssh/arjun
	
Step 2 : Create an RSA key
	Go to the .ssh directory located under users home directory
	# cd ~/.ssh/
	
	Create an RSA key without any passphrase (for test case)
	# ssh-keygen -t rsa
	
	Now after successful creation of the key you should notice 2 files at the place you are.
	1. id_rsa
	2. id_rsa.pub
	
	If you have authorized_keys please back it up
	# mv authorized_keys authorized_keys.YYYYMMDD
	
	Now copy or append the contents of id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys file.
	In my case i am copying as there is no file.
	# cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys
	
	Now copy this file to /etc/ssh/arjun. We need this file in both locations
	# cp -prv ~/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/ssh/arjun/authorized_keys
	
Step 3 : Modify the ssh config file to recognize the ssh keys.
	# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	
	Add the below lines. If you already have these lines then change accordingly.
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
	RSAAuthentication yes
	AuthorizedKeysFile    /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys
	
Step 4 : Restart your SSH service
	# service ssh restart
	
Step 5 : Now you need to able to login to that host without using your password while using the SSH key.
